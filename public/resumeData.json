As a UNSW Co-op Scholar, I have undertaken internships with Atlassian and Optus, and will soon begin a new internship with CBA. At university, I was the President of the UNSW Co-op Society, and travelled to India under the New Colombo Plan Mobility Grant. In my spare time, I love to play Ultimate Frisbee and basketball, read and write, and play music. Currently, I am undertaking the UNSW Web Front-End Programming course, COMP6080. I was also recently selected into the 2021 cohort of the prestigious Westpac Asian Exchange Scholarship. I hope to undertake my exchange program in China in 2022.",
